Build a full-stack University Staff Attendance System using:

Frontend: Next.js (React)
Backend: Flask (Python)

Features:
Login & Access:

Users log in using unique ID and password.

Redirect to role-specific dashboard after login (/dashboard/<role>).

Session holds the user's ID and role.

Roles & Dashboards:

Head: View all attendance and leave requests. Approve/reject leave.

Admin: Manage user accounts (add/edit/delete/view).

Mazer: View & mark teacher attendance. Show today's teachers with subject and time like:

🧑‍💼 Staff on Monday - Schedule & Attendance
Ms. Vanna (S001) – IT_Full-Time – 08:00–17:00 [✔ Present]
Mr. Dara (S002) – IT-Part-Time – 08:00–12:00 [Mark Present]
Teacher/Staff: View own attendance and submit leave requests.

Backend API (Flask):
Authentication

POST /login – Input: {id, password} → Output: {role, name}

Attendance

GET /attendance/<id> – Get personal records

GET /attendance-all – Head/Admin sees all

POST /mark-attendance – Mark attendance with {id, date, status}

Leave

POST /leave-request – Submit leave

GET /leave-requests – Head views pending

POST /leave-requests/respond – Head approves/rejects

Users

GET /users – View all

POST /user – Add

PUT /user/<id> – Edit

DELETE /user/<id> – Delete

Additional Requirements:
Use in-memory dictionaries to simulate a database (no DB needed).

No demo credentials on login page.

Dashboards should be full-screen with no sidebar/navigation.

Attendance marking must be integrated directly into the daily schedule display.

Use Tailwind or basic CSS for styling.

Goal:
A simple, clean role-based system where each user has access to their tools on one page. Mazer and Assistant can mark attendance easily with one click.
